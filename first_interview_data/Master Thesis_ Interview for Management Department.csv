In particular, a detailed formulation can take place on the basis of minor input that contains a predefined framework, such as automatically derived acceptance criteria, test cases, and material supporting a release. AI can also help to find dependencies and thus advance the development of a roadmap. All of this supports strategic work. In general, AI can also be used to support brainstorming and thus enrich strategic thinking. Basically, time is gained for strategic topics and money is saved for operational staff when operational work is carried out by AI.","3","The dataset is often unsuitable or so fragmented that only selective application is possible. It would be ideal if we had more data available today. It is often only qualitative.","5","AI in project management can streamline task formulation, scheduling, and resource allocation while providing valuable insights through data analysis, ultimately improving efficiency and decision-making to enhance project outcomes and productivity.","5","AI can analyze vast amounts of data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations across various organizational functions such as product research & development, sales, and marketing.","5","AI-powered tools are immensely valuable to enable an informed decision-making compared to wild guessing in the unknown.","5","I think that it would be super beneficial, but the effectiveness depends on data quality and the knowledge of working with it to ensure optimal utilization.","Good luck!!"

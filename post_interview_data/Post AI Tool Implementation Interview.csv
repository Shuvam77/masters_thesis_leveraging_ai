"2024/06/26 1:35:17 pm EEST","3","Github Copilot helps in reducing the time to implement very basic code. This allows me to write more complex code or be faster with my assigned tickets. But most of the time I still have to write code myself or have to review the AI generated code.","4","I think of effectiveness as reducing the cost a company has to pay someone for manual work. The AI's cost needs to be lower than the cost of the worker doing the same thing manually. I would say this is given for Github Copilot, while the overall time saving is not that high. It doesn't remove our need for hiring more people.","4","It really depends on the tool and the problem it wants to solve. While Github Copilot was straight forward to implement and use, the reclaim.ai for calendars felt kinda useless to me, since I didn't see any problem with the normal Google calendar that needed to be solved.","2","If software is just written by AI, soon no one will know how any of their Software actually works, which makes it harder to react to bugs or security issues.
I'm not afraid of AI replacing my actual know-how, but of AI companies over-promising their products and influence decision-makers in organizations to replace people by AI, only to realize, way too late, that it doesn't work like that.","3","Github Copilot can reduce the time, but still requires manually reviewing the output code, so the overall cut isn't that high.

"2024/07/04 7:18:12 pm EEST","5","I use AI more and more often in everyday life when texts need to be formulated or rewritten with different wording. In addition, acceptance criteria and other summaries and derivations can be quickly formulated from descriptions. It is also helpful for writing release notes that take a certain tone of voice into account.","4","These are especially topics that have to do with texts. In the future, it would be interesting if metrics, which we would increasingly like to use, could also be evaluated automatically and decision templates generated on this basis. I think that this is technically possible, but we are not yet ready, as the information must be available correctly and in an analyzable form. Native integration into our systems still needs to be established.","5","I feel particularly confident when I enter individual sentences as prompts and the output is so small that I can review each sentence individually and optimize it if necessary. I still have little confidence in accepting a large number of texts without checking them. The last conceivable scenario was the use of AI to formulate API documentation that writes itself automatically based on API endpoints. I think that AI can only handle this poorly, as the selective use of AI is never context-sensitive until it is fully integrated and has a large database at its disposal.","2","I don't think it's arrogant to think that you won't be replaced as long as you still control the use of AI yourself and are therefore needed to coordinate its targeted use. Basically, I'm glad that these tools exist and that I'm relieved of routine mental work. It often feels like I have a secretary who is available to me for a good dozen hours a week and I effectively save this time. In this respect, it actually increases my output and therefore my relevance. In fact, I think humans can never be completely replaced by AI. There will always be another place where only a human can sit.","4","It's about ChatGPT. It formulates rough thoughts in a matter of seconds. Short sentences are often not enough and you need some ""accessories"". This embellishment and enrichment, often with facts that you would have had to research yourself, is brilliant.","3","I give it a mediocre rating because I also get to see a lot of AI-generated content from other people who work with it. It seems to me that some people no longer subject the output of the AI to quality control. As mentioned, AI often makes texts longer, can also include incorrect information and writes generic texts if the prompts are poor and the context is not provided. ","4","I use AI particularly for simple, routine tasks. Complex tasks can only be solved in my case if I break them down myself, evaluate the AI's output, and put everything back together based on my own knowledge and experience.","4","As I said before, it is mainly the simple tasks of mental routine work or when I want to quickly incorporate information into texts that are found in textbooks and I would have otherwise googled. However, I still google and verify them because I don't deliver texts that contain incorrect facts. In this respect, new work has also been created.","3","Actually, I haven't yet used AI for quantitative purposes; so far, I've only used qualitative AI. That may change hopefully when we have more metrics and corresponding business intelligence and analysis tools available.","5","It has far exceeded my expectations. Three years ago, when I had a colleague titled ""Head of AI"" at my old company and often discussed with him, I couldn't have imagined what AI would be capable of in such a short time and how significant a part of my daily life it would become. I believe it has even surprised the experts, like him. AI is true magic and continues to fascinate me every day anew.","","","","A lot. Writing release notes, for example, is super annoying, especially when it happens long after initially dealing with a ticket. You always had to re-familiarize yourself with a topic. AI takes over this process, analyzes it, and writes an almost perfect summary.","Yes, in that it saves an enormous amount of time. The workflow remains nearly the same but can be completed in a fraction of the time (let's say less than 20% of the original processing time in the case of release notes).","5","","","","The chatbot for the helpdesk is highly expandable, but this is hindered by the currently modest data foundation. We lack sufficient data. As a result, the AI sometimes starts to speculate and suggests solutions that have nothing to do with the actual application. The problem is that these suggestions are presented with great confidence. Customers would not appreciate this, even if we tell them that this is not a real human, so we have not tested it with customers yet.","As mentioned earlier, due to the inappropriate responses of the JSM Bot, it has remained limited to an internal test so far.","1","","",""
